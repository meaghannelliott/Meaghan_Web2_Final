          25 years ago, in the blistering summer heat of Barcelona, everything changed. The haters said it could never happen, but we made history. In that summer of 1992, 11 hall of famers came together to form the greatest team, ever assembled, in the history of team sports…wait…scratch that…that’s the history of the Dream Team, what were we thinking?

        <h4>
          Back in 2012 some friends with a shared love of cycling and too much time on their hands started a fake race team. From an old VW van in Topanga, California we built a team with a strict focus on looking good and having fun. A small batch of kits for friends eventually turned into some sweatshirts and hats, which, largely because of a few die-hard, loyal customers, has blossomed into the Team Dream you’re seeing now

        <h4>
          After our first few humble batches, we decided that we wanted to do more than just put our graphics on jerseys and tees. We wanted to make the clothing we would want to wear ourselves, and find a way to make it in Los Angeles. We started working on sourcing our own materials & designing our own fits in 2013. Since then, we’ve been hands-on with all of our apparel manufacturers to develop products that are 100% approved by Team Dream. That means we spend a whole lot of time on every t-shirt, sweatshirt, jersey and bib we sell. Being involved with every step of production means we bring you the best possible finished product.

          Fast forward to today, Team Dream is working with a very small number of special retail partners globally, though most of our sales still come through our web store. From the beginning, the brand was built around selling direct to the consumer to keep the pricing obtainable (and let's be honest, most bicycle shops have already blacklisted Sean for bringing in feral cats during his visits). Since the majority of our stuff is sold direct to you, we are able to use the best possible materials & domestic production while saving you money on high quality apparel.

          After some negotiating (and a lot of begging) we worked enough magic to get keys to the place. The Cub House in South Pasadena opened in late 2015. In addition to being the temporary office for both Team Dream and Ringtail, The Cub House grew into a local spot for cyclists to hang out and buy cycling product they had only seen prior on the internet. We began to carry much more than just Team Dream and watched the space evolve into a cycling apparel store stocking more than 15 other small brands. Stray cats, much like vampires, have to be invited into your home in order to wreak havoc, but just like those pasty blood suckers, once the Team Dream boys are in the door there is no getting rid of us! That being said, what was originally scheduled to be a 6 month pop-up shop lasted much longer. Until one day the lights went out and the wrecking ball showed up.

          We were back out on the street, but it didn't take long for us to spot our next home. A mile down the road we found a service station turned greenhouse and began a whole new set of negotiations to move in our growing empire. In 2017 the current location of The Cub House opened at 2510 Mission Street in San Marino, California.
